vimEnv
======

Jason's .vimrc and vim plugins managed by pathogen located in .vim/

Installation
------

```Bash
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/toyCoder/vimEnv.git
```

Attention
------

  If you want to use plugin vim-go, please be sure all the necessary binaries are installed (such as `gocode`, `godef`, 
`goimports`, etc..). You can easily install them with the included `GoInstallBinarie`. <br>

  If you failed to execute `:GoInstallBinarie` caused by the motherf**k wall, you'll need to get the gotools packages via [gopm.io](http://gopm.io/download)

  See more details in [fatih/vim-go](https://github.com/fatih/vim-go).
